# Lex V1 + Voiceflow Demo

This repository contains two different types of Voiceflow integrations. These implementations are lightweight proof-of-concept projects that are meant to be expanded on.

### EXPORT: Voiceflow Project to Lex V1 Bot

[[documentation]](https://github.com/voiceflow/lex-demo/blob/master/lib/export/README.md)

Convert the voiceflow project file (.vf) format to a standalone Lex bot, where responses are handled by Lex.

### RUNTIME: Lex V1 NLU + Voiceflow Runtime

[[documentation]](https://github.com/voiceflow/lex-demo/blob/master/lib/runtime/README.md)

Call Lex V1 to resolve an user's request to an intent, and send that intent to Voiceflow's runtime to generate a response.
